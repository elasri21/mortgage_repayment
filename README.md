## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge that i built.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) is a website that offers challenges that help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this mortgage repayment calculator and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

users should be able to:

- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
